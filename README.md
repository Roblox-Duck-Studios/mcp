   rewrite ./react-roblox mcp server with these documentation information of how they approach react in roblox typescript. Please use roblox typescript, not luau in the documentation.
  Here are some conventions you MUST follow despite the examples

  component names MUST be PascalCase
  file structure MUST be kekab-case and file names MUST be kekab-case
  you SHOULD only usePx, don't use other ways to get px values in @rbxts/ui-scaler
  remember to write a dedicated page on project structure for react so I can review your thoughts
